## Question

Propose an implementation approach for this ticket. Include:

### 1. Files to Modify/Create
List every file that needs to change, with a one-line description of what changes.

### 2. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Ordered list of implementation steps. Be specific about what code to write, not just "add a function".

### 3. Key Design Decisions
Trade-offs you considered and why you chose this approach over alternatives.

### 4. Risks and Gotchas
Things that could go wrong, edge cases to watch for, backwards compatibility concerns.

### 5. Testing Strategy
What tests to write, what to assert, how to verify the feature works end-to-end.

## Output Format

Structure your response with the five sections above. Be concrete and specific — this plan will be handed to an implementation agent.
